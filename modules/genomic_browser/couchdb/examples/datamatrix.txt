### This file is a example of a datamatrix file expected by the CouchDB importer of LORIS. 
### File following this format will be transformed into a dataset.json file and N variable.json files. (Where N is the number of data lines)
### An additionnal file must be provided to add annotations to each variable (row). This additionnal file must be part of the same fileset_id in mysql.
###
### Comment line start with (###).
### Those lines will be ignored.
###
### Any informations about history or provenance should be on a line stating with (##). 
### Those informations should be represented as key, value pairs and will be kept as string.
### The key needs to be a single word at the start of the line.
### The actual separator is single comma.
### Invalid lines will be ommited.
### The following information are required :
### --REQUIRED--> variable_type: This is used to create the tabs in the genomic browser. 
### --REQUIRED--> variable_format: One of float, integer, string. variable values will always be stored as string be this specify of to display them.
### --REQUIRED--> sample_count: How many column to treat as samples starting from the right of the matrix
###
### The headers line should start with a single (#).
### There should be only one headers line.
### The first column will always be considered as the variable_ids and the following column should be the n sample_labels where n = sample_count.
### Sample label will not be modified.
### The lines following the headers will be considered as data line.
###
### Data lines should contain 1 column before the samples columns :
### --REQUIRED--> variable_name, the unique identifier of the variable.
###
### The parser script will stop at the first invalid line.
### 
### See ./datamatrix.annotations for detail about the annotations format specifications.
